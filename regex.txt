Pattern: ((great )*grand)?((fa|mo)ther)
Addition: \$1 = `$1`\n\$2 = `$2`\n\$3 = `$3`\n\$4 = `$4` to find and replace the target string
Target:
	father
	mother
	grandfather
	grandmother
	great grandmother
	great grandfather
	great great grandmother
	great great grandfather

Example:

I. Target: great great grandfather

$1 = `great great grand`
$2 = `great `
$3 = `father`
$4 = `fa`

II. Target: grandfather

$1 = `grand`
$2 = ``
$3 = `father`
$4 = `fa`

III. Target: great grandmother

$1 = `great grand`
$2 = `great `
$3 = `mother`
$4 = `mo`

The plus, the star and the repetition using curly braces are greedy.
